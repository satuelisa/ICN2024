# Network Science using Python

Lecturer: Elisa Schaeffer

Language: English, with instructor support in French and Spanish

Date: International Week 2024

## Course description and content

Network science is the art of using mathematical and computational concepts and techniques to model, understand, describe, shape, and predict networked systems that are abundant in biological, technological, economic and sociological contexts: the brain, a highway system, the stock market, social media, just to name a few.

This is an introductory course tailored for those who are new to network science that can also accommodate newcomers to Python. Some programming experience is recommended, but none is required. No mathematical previous knowledge is required, although those skilled in mathematics can challenge themselves with more complex tasks when applying the concepts in their personal worksheets for each session.

## Teaching Method

* Collaborative construction of an [trilingual illustrated glossary with code examples](https://www.overleaf.com/read/htcnfptdxzcd#59c09b)
* Interactive exploration of key concepts through per-session Colab notebooks.
* All course materials are electronic and publicly available online. 

## Learning objectives addressed

1. Identify real-world situations that can be modeled through network science.
2. Characterize the structure of networked systems in graph-theoretical terms.
3. Detect communities in networked systems.
4. Select an efficient solution technique for diverse graph-theoretical problems.

## Assessment method

At the end of each of the seven sessions, each student commits their individual Colab worksheet to a public GitHub repository for future reference. The grading of the worksheet is done synchronously in class as co-evaluation jointly between the lecturer and the participant as a one-minute review of the worksheet to assess for criteria on a three-level scale. The rubric of the criteria and the scale is the following:

1. Functioning Python code for the sessionâ€™s concepts:
   * absent = 0
   * partial = 0.5
   * complete = 1
3. Visualizations generated by the above code:
   * absent = 0
   * illegible = 0.5
   * legible = 1
5. Use of comments within the code:
   * absent = 0
   * unclear = 0.5
   * helpful to future self = 1
7. Notes on graph-theoretical definitions:
   * absent = 0
   * unclear = 0.5
   * helpful to future self = 1

Note that one worksheet may give up to 4 points. Hence, the best five of the seven worksheets are used to determine the final grade on a scale of 20.
